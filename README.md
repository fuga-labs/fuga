## 🌈 Installation

Get started by installing Fuga and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install sass zod && npm install fuga
```

## 💡 Usage

Here’s a sneak peek of what your Fuga-powered Svelte code can look like:

```svelte
<script>
	import { Box } from 'fuga';
</script>

<Box
	as="button"
	px="8"
	py="4"
	p="20px"
	bgColor={{ base: 'blue-100', md: 'blue-400', lg: 'blue-500' }}
	_hover={{ color: 'blue-300' }}
	onclick={() => console.log('clicked!!')}
>
	Click Me
</Box>
```

With Fuga, styles are passed as props that automatically compile into CSS! This example shows how easy it is to add responsive, interactive styling without touching a CSS file. ✨ Zod handles the runtime validation of these props, catching issues right in the browser console to keep your code predictable and error-free.

## 🔍 What’s Next?

Soon, Fuga will feature a wide range of components such as:

- **Button**
- **Accordion**
- **Alert**

- and many more! Stay tuned for these additions and make Fuga your go-to library for Svelte components.
